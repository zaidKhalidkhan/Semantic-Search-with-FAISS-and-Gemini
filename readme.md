Image Embeddings and Semantic Search with CLIP, FAISS, and Gemini
Overview
This project aims to generate embeddings of an image dataset using OpenAI's CLIP model, store these embeddings, and perform semantic search using FAISS. Additionally, Gemini is used to generate context-based refined queries to enhance the search functionality.
